# Real-Time Digital Temperature Monitoring System

## Overview
A real-time temperature monitoring system designed to measure, process, and visualize temperature data using both hardware and software components.

## System Description
The system uses a temperature sensor interfaced with a microcontroller to collect real-time data. The readings are transmitted to a computer for processing and visualization as a Temperature vs Time graph.

## Engineering Context
Such systems are widely used in robotics, industrial monitoring, and smart infrastructure for environmental sensing and system safety.

## My Role
Group leader responsible for system integration, data analysis, and coordination of software–hardware interaction.

## Tools & Technologies
- LM35 Temperature sensor
- Arduino Uno Microcontroller
- MATLAB (for data visualization)
- Digital electronics principles

## Results
The system successfully displayed real-time temperature changes and plotted accurate Temperature vs Time graphs with a step of one second.
